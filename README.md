# macOS Patcher
macOS Patcher is a command line tool for running macOS on unsupported Macs

# Catalina Unus
Catalina Unus is a command line tool for running macOS Catalina on one HFS or APFS volume. It's integrated into macOS Patcher so you if you have a Mac supported by it, you can use it by running sudo ./macOS\ Patcher.sh -unus.

# Important
It's highly recommended to backup your Mac, do a clean install, and migrate the data during setup, cause Catalina Unus has trouble with Catalina's data migration process.

# Brightness Slider and NoSleep
If you have a MacBook4,1, you might notice two little applications have been installed along with macOS Patcher's other patches. They help solve specific issues on the MacBook4,1 and should be opened and configured after patching. NoSleep is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/integralpro/nosleep). Brightness Slider is made by ACT Productions and can be found on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brightness-control/id456624497?ls=1&mt=12).

# Graphics acceleration
If you have a MacBook4,1, your Mac won't support graphics acceleration with this patcher. This means brightness control and sleep won't work (see above) and applications that rely on your graphics card will perform slower or will simply not work.
